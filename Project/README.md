## What case are we solving?
It is necessary to write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts

Copmetition conditions:

* The computer guesses an integer from 0 to 100, and we need to guess it. By "guess" is meant "write a program that will guess the number."
* The algorithm takes into account information about whether a random number is greater or less than the one we need.

Quality metric The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts with 1000 repetitions

What we practice

* Learn to write good python code.
* Learn to work with IDE.
* Learn to work with GitHub.
## Brief information about the date
As data, we generate a numpy array of random integers from 1 to 100 inclusive.

## Stages of work on the project

* Task evaluation
* Method release
* Evaluation of the result
* Registration of results in a notebook
* Design README.md

## Result:
The number of attempts was reduced to 6-7

## Conclusions:
The method of finding the number by the method of half division corresponds to the task and shows the result better than the threshold value of 20.
